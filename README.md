This repo contains the code and graphics for my article on fourth-down decision-making in CFB: https://www.fromtherumbleseat.com/2024/1/19/24028303/georgia-tech-football-to-be-or-not-to-be-aggressive-analytics-ncaa-fourth-downs-nfl-big-data-bowl

## Usage

It's not fully cleaned up, but it should be fairly straight forward to use for your own analysis. The cleaned fourth-down decision data for 2014 to 2023 is contained in `./data/fourth_down_decisions_14_23.RDS`. The code to generate this file is commented out in `fourth-downs.R`, while the code to produce all of the graphics is still active.

## License

There's no license on this data. Please just provide a link to this repo or [cfbfastR](https://cfbfastR.sportsdataverse.org) and [cfb4th](https://cfb4th.sportsdataverse.org) if you're using any of the data.

## Support

Please use the Issues tab to report anything weird-looking with the data. Other than for fixing major issues, this repo and data come as-is and I probably will not keep it up to date.
